All course materials will be provided for you, and you do not need to purchase any books. You do need to ensure you have an adequate computer and data for study. You need:
- A functioning laptop
- Headphones or device to enable you to speak clearly
- Adequate data for work and study

You will be required to use a number of software programs (e.g., Google Workspace, Zoom, Github, etc.) for your classes. All software will be provided at no cost to you, and you will be given a list of software tools to install on your computer the week before orientation. You will be provided with a Kibo google account (e.g., yourname@kibo.school) which you will use for all your coursework.

## Payment

## General
#### How do the Kibo hubs work? Do I have to attend classes at the hub?
The Kibo learning hub are geographical communities of Kibo learners who live within a close distance of one another. You will not need to attend mandatory in-person classes. However, our team will organize optional social and professional meetups for you to build in-person connections with the Kibo community.

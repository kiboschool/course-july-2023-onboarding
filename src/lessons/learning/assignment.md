## Pick up your laptop

In order to learn at Kibo, you are required to have a well-functioning laptop computer, and to setup the computer with important tools and accounts. Information on computer setup will be shared with you next week. 
Later this week, you will receive an email notification with details of when and where to pick up your laptop. Once you receive the notification, please make plans to pick up your device as soon as possible. 

## Send Your ID Photo
If you have not done so already, please refer to last week's [assignment](lessons/welcome/assignment.md) and submit your ID photo.

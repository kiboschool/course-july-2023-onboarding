## Confirm your current location
We need to confirm your current physical address, so that:

## Pick up your laptop

Later this week, you will receive an email notification with details of when and where to pick up your laptop. **Once you receive the notification, please make plans to pick up your device as soon as possible.**

Next week, we will share a computer setup guide with information on accounts and tools to install on your laptop. 

## Review the checklist
Once you complete the above, be sure to review the [checklist](/checklist.md) for a list of taks that you should have completed up to this point.

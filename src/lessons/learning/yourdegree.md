## Program Learning Outcomes

Kibo is committed to educating connected innovators who use technology to solve pressing problems. Therefore, our degree is intentionally designed to produce graduates who:

1. **Learn continuously:** Kibo graduates are self-directed and persistent learners who demonstrate a belief in their ability to grow their knowledge and skills. They can set learning goals, implement strategies to acquire and apply new knowledge, and reflect on their learning.
2. **Think analytically:** Kibo graduates can analyze and evaluate diverse information, experiences, and multiple points of view. They use appropriate strategies and frameworks to evaluate problems and make decisions.
3. **Behave ethically:** Kibo graduates recognize ethical and professional responsibilities, use moral principles to guide their thinking, and consider the individual and societal impacts of their decisions.
4. **Interact effectively:** Kibo graduates communicate thoughtfully and effectively in writing, speaking, and non-verbal exchange. They can work in teams to accomplish a common purpose, including setting goals, maintaining individual accountability, giving and receiving feedback, and identifying and resolving interpersonal conflicts.
5. **Lead successfully:** Kibo graduates can envision future goals and outcomes, and outline and prioritize activities to meet those goals. They strive for professional and personal excellence.
6. **Build modern software:** Kibo graduates use modern tools and methods to design software solutions, including problem identification, design, development, and documentation.
7. **Apply computer science principles:** Kibo graduates can apply computer science theory and algorithmic principles to model and design solutions to complex problems.

Summary of the thematic components of the Kibo CS degree.

To achieve the above outcomes you will take courses in both the general education and computer science domains.

### **General Education curriculum**

The general education curriculum helps you develop critical [**human skills**](https://jwel.mit.edu/human-skills-matrix) that support your ability to use technology to drive positive impact. It aims to create emotionally intelligent and purpose-driven computer science graduates. General education courses fall into two main categories:

**Leadership:** These courses help you develop foundational skills for managing yourself and interacting effectively with others. During the first year, you will learn how to become successful self-directed learners, improve your written and verbal communication, and learn to collaborate effectively with peers. In later years, you will complete courses on the ethical implications of technological innovation, so that you are prepared to be responsible professionals who can reflect on the consequences of the technologies that you create.Â  The degree culminates with you applying design thinking to your lives and vocation, to support you in making meaningful plans for your life after Kibo.

***Courses under this category include: Optimizing Your Learning, Communicating for Success, Ethics in Tech, Designing Your Future.***

**Impact:** These courses challenge you to think critically about global problems, and ideate and implement technology solutions. You will first investigate the role that technology has played in addressing some of the worldâ€™s most intractable social and economic development challenges. Then you will select a challenge and work with your peers to create a technology solution that is meaningful to you. Through these courses, you will go from problem analysis through ideation, prototyping, iteration, and business model development, and are equipped with tools to pursue an entrepreneurial path should that be of interest.

***Courses under this category include: Engineering for Development, Challenge Studio 1.***

### Technical CS curriculum

The technical curriculum is designed to expose you to a breadth of topics in computer science, along with the requisite work experience to launch an impactful career.

The technical curriculum begins with introductory courses that provide a foundation in computer science and web development in the first year of the degree. You learn the theoretical underpinnings of computer science and understand how to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. You explore seminal developments in computing and investigate the current ways that technology is shaping society. You then consolidate your knowledge by building a web application and completing an industry experience (e.g. an internship). 

In the next two years of the program, you build on your technical foundation and deepen your knowledge of computer science. Technical coursework delves deeper into computing, with a focus on systems, advanced algorithms, and understanding large networks. You can also take courses to specialize in particular areas of interest (e.g., web and mobile development, data science, machine learning & artificial intelligence). Through industry experience, you continue to engage in the authentic practice of technical and professional skills.

## A Stackable Degree

Kibo offers a stackable degree with credentials available at the end of each year of the program. The final credential that you will earn at the end of your third year is a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. However, after successful completion of year 1 of the program, you will earn a Diploma in Computer Science. And after successful completion of year 2 of the program, you will earn a Higher Diploma in Computer Science.

# Academic Accounts

You will use many accounts and tools for your learning at Kibo. Like a technologist, you will become adept at using the right tools for the job! 

The key account for your learning will be your Google Kibo Account, e.g., yourname@kibo.school. During your time at Kibo, you will complete lessons, receive communications, and register for and use tools with a  Kibo Google Workspace for Education account. An account has already been created for you. **Going forward, all Kibo-related communications will be sent to this account, and you need to check it daily.**

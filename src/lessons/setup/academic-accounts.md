## 1 - Attendance and Academic Engagement Policy

Students are expected to remain academically engaged in all classes. **The requirement for satisfactory academic engagement is to submit all assigned work by the published due date.**

Students will be deemed academically disengaged in a class if the student has an assignment which is 7 or more days late. Academic disengagement carries with it a number of possible penalties, including and up to dismissal from Kibo.

In addition to meeting the requirements for academic engagement, students are expected to actively participate in learning activities. Learning at Kibo involves a variety of experiences including:

- Attending scheduled sessions (e.g., live class or office hours) where there is opportunity for interaction with the instructor and/or peers
- Submitting academic assignments, quizzes, or projects
- Taking exams, or engaging in online tutorials and instruction
- Attending a study group that is assigned by the instructor
- Participating in an online discussion about academic matters
- Initiating contact with an instructor to ask a question about the class

Students should inform their instructor if personal emergencies arise that prevent satisfactory academic engagement. A student who is ill for more than a week and/or expects to not remain academically engaged due to personal, family or other emergency should also contact their advisor and the Dean.

## 2 - Academic Honesty & Integrity Policy

Kibo School does not tolerate any form of academic misconduct, such as cheating, fabrication, or plagiarism. 

**Cheating** is an intentional effort at deception or gaining an unfair advantage in completing academic work.  

**Plagiarism** is the deliberate use of the work of another person without giving full credit to the original author for their contribution with a proper citation. 

**Fabrication** includes, but is not limited to, falsifying or inventing information or research.

The following list is not exhaustive, but includes some examples that would constitute a violation of the policy:

- Creating a bibliography with fabricated sources or citing as sources references that were not used in the preparation of academic work
- Copying and/or submitting writing, source code, ideas, designs, or other elements without proper citation and permission of the owner
- Hiring someone to complete an assignment or project
- Collaborating with classmates or others on work where the instructor has explained that only individual work is permitted
- Allowing a classmate to copy work so that they can pass it off as their own
- Using unauthorized software or electronic devices during an examination

Any student found to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action including dismissal. Any student who assists another in an activity that constitutes a violation of academic integrity is also responsible and accountable for such a violation.

## 3 - Student Code of Conduct

Kibo School is committed to creating an environment in which each individual can learn, work and thrive without feeling excluded, unsafe, or harassed. Kibo promotes respect for each person regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, culture, religion, or disability. Accordingly, all members of the Kibo community (students, staff, instructors, mentors, and guests) have a shared responsibility for ethical, responsible, and respectful behavior that complies with applicable laws and the guidelines set forth in this code of conduct.  All community members are expected to behave with common courtesy and are required to follow the tenets of the Code of Conduct in all Kibo School communities (e.g., online learning environments, social media, in-person gatherings, etc.)

### 3.1 - Communication Expectations

Learning how to professionally and effectively communicate is a key component of a student’s educational experience at Kibo School. Students are expected to engage in professional conduct through all communication mediums with students, staff, instructors, mentors, and guests. Professional communication is communication that:

- Uses respectful language, and is aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Is open to discussion, debate, and free flow of ideas
- Is timely in both giving and receiving information

In addition to keeping staff and instructors up-to-date on anything that may impact their ability to fully engage in their learning, students are responsible for regularly checking their Kibo School email and digital communities (e.g. Discord), and responding to correspondence within one business day of outreach by instructors or staff.

### 3.2 - Prohibited Conduct

The following behavior is prohibited for all members of the Kibo School community:

- **Bullying, Threatening, and Abusive Behavior**
    - Engaging in or threatening to engage in behavior(s) that, by virtue of their intensity, repetitiveness, or otherwise, endanger or compromise the health, safety or well-being of oneself, another person, or the general School community, or that disrupt the effective continuation of the academic/educational process for individual students or for the general School community. This includes, but is not limited to, threatening, tormenting, mocking, intimidating, maliciously or inappropriately ridiculing another’s work or comments beyond the scope of scholarly inquiry, and exploiting known psychological or physical vulnerabilities or impairment.
    - Abusive behavior toward school staff or representatives in the performance of their duties.
    - Physical violence, actual or threatened, against any individual or group of persons.

- **Disorderly Conduct**
    - Behaviors that, by virtue of their intensity and/or repetitiveness, interfere with an educational activity (e.g., remote or online learning environments, meetups, office hours, etc.). This includes but is not limited to: persistently talking without being recognized; creating noise that obstructs the learning process; smoking/vaping or use of prohibited substances; repeatedly interrupting others, or deliberately engaging in other behaviors that unreasonably and illegitimately distract from or interfere with the educational experience.

- **Hazing**
    - Physical and/or psychological abuse or the threat of such abuse of any person on school platforms or at school activities. This includes hazing, which is defined as the initiation or discipline of fellow students by means of horseplay, practical jokes, or tricks, often in the nature of humiliating or painful ordeals.

- **Harassment & Sexual Misconduct**
    - Title IX protects students enrolled in educational programs or activities from gender discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. More specifically, it protects against any conduct that has the intent or effect of unreasonably interfering with one’s performance at Kibo School, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, and pervasive environment. Examples of misconduct include (but are not limited to) offensive verbal comments, inappropriate physical contact, deliberate intimidation, sexual images in public spaces, and exclusionary or offensive jokes. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

- **Retaliation**
    - Participating in any adverse action against an individual for making a good faith report of prohibited conduct or participating in any proceeding under this policy. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing or any other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this policy.

### 3.3 - Local Laws

All students are expected to follow local, state, and federal laws at all times. Kibo School may determine, on a case-by-case basis, to address violations of local law through the student conduct process if the violation poses a health or safety risk to the school community or is detrimental to the educational interest of others.

### 3.4 - Non-Academic Dismissal

A student who is deemed to be in violation of the Student Code of Conduct may be dismissed based on the seriousness of the violation, a combination of violations, and whether prior violations have already occurred. The Dean is responsible for reviewing Code of Conduct violations and determining appropriate disciplinary measures. Students who are subject to non-academic discipline including dismissal will be notified of the institution’s decision and any potential re-admission terms will be identified at that time.

## 4 - Complaints Process

Kibo School does not accept any violation of the Code of Conduct.  Kibo School is committed to providing students, instructors, administrators, and other stakeholders with a safe environment and positive experience. If a member of the Kibo School community has a concern, they are encouraged to first direct their concern to the faculty, staff, or administrator involved. Those asked to stop inappropriate behaviors are expected to comply immediately and may face further disciplinary action.

Should the issue not be resolved at that point, or should the member not feel comfortable directing the complaint or the person(s) involved, they are encouraged to register a complaint with Kibo School. To keep our community safe, we encourage reporting conduct violations and will maintain reporter privacy to the extent permissible by law and policy.

A complaint is an educational issue or condition that a student believes to be unfair, inequitable, discriminatory or a hindrance to his or her education. Kibo School seeks to resolve complaints quickly and to the satisfaction of the aggrieved party.

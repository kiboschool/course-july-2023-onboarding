## The Squad Cup

The Squad Cup is Kibo’s intramural competition between squads. You can think of it as our version of the Hogwarts House Cup. During the term, squads complete activities to win points toward the Cup, and the squad with the most points at the end of each term is crowned the winner.

You can create a thread to write a reply to one of the posts or add your thoughts to a thread that has already been created. If you press the Control key and click on the message that you want to respond to, you will get a small menu with different options for what you can do. You can also click the emojis symbol with a + sign to add an emoji reaction to the post.

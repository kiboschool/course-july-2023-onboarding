## Step 1 - Introduce Yourself to the Community

Go to the [Introductions channel](https://discord.com/channels/1018949047626760252/1120361847116279828) and introduce yourself to the community by telling us:
    1. Your full name
    2. Your location
    3. A fun fact about you.
    4. Then post an image or gif that represents you.

**TIP:** Post your text message first, then post your gif/image as a separate message afterward.


## Step 2 - Set Up Your Profile

1. Find your username in the right sidebar.

4. Update your **Server Nickname** to your first name and last name initial **(e.g., Oyin A, Ope B)**. This will change your nickname in the Kibo Degree Program server only.

To customize the rest of your profile:

1. Now go to "User Profile".

2. Upload a profile photo as your **avatar.**
3. In the About Me section, add a **description** with a sentence or two about who you are, or include a quote you like.


## Step 3 - Read, React, and Reply to Other People's Introductions

Spend some time reading through your classmates’ introductions. 

Maybe you’ll find someone with a similar interest as you or someone who lives in the same city as you! You can create a thread to write a reply to one of the posts or add your thoughts to a thread that has already been created. If you press the Control key and click on the message that you want to respond to, you will get a small menu with different options for what you can do. You can also click the emojis symbol with a + sign to add an emoji reaction to the post.


## Step 4 - Add Your Birthday to the Server [Optional]

Type this message in the #random channel: **/remember-birthday MM-DD** 

Where MM is the numerical month of your birthday (March = 03) and DD is the day. So March 8 would be 03-08.

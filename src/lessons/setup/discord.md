## Step 1 - Introduce Yourself to the Community

1. Tell us: 
    1. Your full name
    2. Your location
    3. A fun fact about you.
2. Then post an image or gif that represents you.

**TIP:** Post your text message first, then post your gif/image as a separate message afterward.


## Step 2 - Complete the Rest of the Onboarding Steps.

Follow the instructions on the screen and complete the rest of the onboarding steps.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOU9ODzPsNc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>  

Here is a summary of the steps to update your profile:

1. Click on your username in the right sidebar, then click the pencil icon to edit your profile.
2. Select “Edit Server Profile"
3. Update your **nickname** to your first name and last name initial **(e.g., Oyin A, Ope B)**. This will change your nickname in the Kibo Degree Program server only.

To customize the rest of your profile:

1. Click again on your username in the right sidebar. This time click "Edit User Profile".
2. Upload a profile photo as your **avatar.**
3. In the About Me section, add a **description** with a sentence or two about who you are, or include a quote you like.


## Step 4 - Read, React, and Reply to Your Classmates’ Introductions

Spend some time reading through your classmates’ introductions. 

Maybe you’ll find someone with a similar interest as you or someone who lives in the same city as you! You can create a thread to write a reply to one of the posts or add your thoughts to a thread that has already been created. If you press the Control key and click on the message that you want to respond to, you will get a small menu with different options for what you can do. You can also click the emojis symbol with a + sign to add an emoji reaction to the post.

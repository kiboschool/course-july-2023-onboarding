## The gift of feedback
We are so excited to have you at Kibo! 

One of the things you'll notice at Kibo is that we ask for feedback (a lot!). These surveys and questionnaires are important to us, and we use them to make many changes to Kibo's programs and offerings. Throughout your experience, you'll be asked to:

- Provide feedback on live class each week
- Provide feedback at the end of each term
- Provide ad-hoc feedback 


## Complete the Baseline Survey
The baseline survey is designed to help us collect some background information about you and your goals before you begin classes.

<aside> ü§î Why are we asking these questions? </aside>

Our aim is for your time at Kibo to be transformation. You will notice the difference and growth in yourself with the passing of each term and year. This survey helps to give us (and you) a _baseline_ of where you are starting today. At the end of each term, we also ask you to evaluate the term, and update some of your answers. This will help ensure that we (and you) are doing our jobs, and progressively helping you get to your peak. 

**Please note that your answers will be only shared anonymously and in aggregated form with the Kibo team and stakeholders.

# Baseline Survey
-----

The baseline survey is designed to help us collect some background information about you and your goals before you begin classes.

<aside> ðŸ¤” Why are we asking these questions? </aside>

Your time at Kibo will be **transformational**. You will notice the difference and growth in yourself with the passing of each term and year. This survey helps to give us (and you) a _baseline_ of where you are starting today. At the end of each term, we will also ask you to evaluate the past term. This will help ensure that we (and you) are doing everything we can to help you reach your peak.

The baseline survey will ask:
- Questions about your educational and family background
- Questions about your goals for coming to Kibo
- Questions about your current and desired job and income, if any

**Please note that your answers will be only shared anonymously and in aggregated form with the Kibo team and stakeholders.**

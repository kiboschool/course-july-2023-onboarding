# Pay your tuition

Once you have confirmed your enrollment, you must pay the tuition fee listed in the agreement. You must pay the balance of tuition before the beginning of class on July 10, 2023.   Be sure to double check with your bank or funding source, and understand the additional cost/fees associated with transferring funds. Although you have the option to pay your tuition balance per term, it may make sense to pay more upfront to avoid the extra transfer costs.

### Paying USD from Nigeria

Obtaining US Dollars in Nigeria is difficult due to the restrictions of foreign exchange. Below are recommended options for paying in USD Nigerian students.

**Pay in USD from a domiciliary account:** if you or your sponsor have an existing USD domiciliary account, you can make payment from that account. 

**Use a money transfer service to obtain USD:** money transfer services such as Western Union, KiaKiaFX may enable you to exchange and/or transfer. We cannot recommend a specific service and encourage you to confirm transfer fees or charges before using a platform.

## Paying with your local currency

**Paying in Nigerian Naira**

We now support the ability to pay your tuition fees in Naira. When making a payment in Naira, you must convert your stated tuition balance to Naira. Please note that our USD to Naira exchange rate is **$1:N600**. When sending payment, you must include your Kibo ID in the transaction details so that we know the payment is for you. 

Account Number: 3000117480

Bank: Kuda Microfinance Bank

Account Name: Kibo Educational Services Ltd.


**A note about the conversion rate:**

The Kibo tuition payment exchange rate is different from the official exchange rate published by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Unfortunately, Nigeria has an ongoing foreign exchange crisis. It is extremely difficult to convert Naira to US Dollars and virtually impossible to do so at the official rate. Most individuals and businesses use the parallel (aka “black”) market to exchange. For the past 3 months, the Dollar to Naira parallel market exchange rate has been between N608 to N723.  Kibo incurs its expenses (e.g., paying instructor salaries) in dollars and must use the parallel market rate when obtaining dollars. Therefore our exchange rate has been set to offset that balance.

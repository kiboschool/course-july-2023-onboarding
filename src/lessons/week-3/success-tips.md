## Top 5 Tips for Succeeding and Overcoming Challenges at Kibo

**Tip 1**: Starting a new degree can seem overwhelming as you face new courses that bring new challenges. You may also feel like you do not have a rhythm for your work yet. That is okay. The degree program has just begun, and it is okay to be anxious or worried. However, remember that you can turn your anxiety into productivity by channeling your energy into the motivation you need to get your work done.

**Tip 2**: As you move towards your academic goals, you will face challenges. Situations and circumstances might not always be the best to support your goals. In these times, don't let challenges keep you down. Routinely reflect on why you enrolled in Kibo and are pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Your â€˜whyâ€™ can help you strengthen your resolve to not give up and keep pushing. Remember, each step you take brings you closer to achieving your educational goals, unlocking your potential, and making a positive impact on the world around you. 

**Tip 3**: As James Clear says, "We do not rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems." So While having good goals is a critical step, make sure you utilize good learning habits that will help you to achieve your goals. 


**Tip 4**: Don't be discouraged by setbacks. Use them as opportunities for improvement. Take a moment to reflect on what went wrong, and move forward with renewed determination. Stay focused and organized. Break down your work into manageable tasks and create a schedule to help you stay on track or catch up. Prioritize your work and tackle the most important tasks first. Take a moment to visualize your success. Picture yourself completing your work with confidence and satisfaction. Then take action by completing them.


**Tip 5**: Kibo's value, 'Better Togetherâ€™, is a testament to the importance we place on supporting each other in our community. In order to do this effectively, it is important that we build a healthy culture of open and honest communication. In case you are not able to show up for your team meeting, attend a class, meet with your advisor or submit an assignment on time, it is good practice to ensure that you communicate the same. This will ensure that we are all on the same page and we are able to support each other effectively. As John Powell said, "Communication works for those who work at it."

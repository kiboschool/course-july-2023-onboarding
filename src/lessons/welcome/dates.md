## Save the dates for Orientation
Orientation week is one of the most exciting weeks at Kibo. During this time, you will meet the Kibo community (classmates, staff, instructors), and get fully prepared to begin class. You can see some of the reflections from the last orientation here, here, or here. 

More information about orientation will be shared with you. For now, the most important thing is to save the date. Orientation begins on Monday July 3. Please hold time that week from 4pm-7pm GMT for mandatory orientation activities on Zoom. On Saturday July 8, we will have in-person orientation events in our hubs where you will get to meet Kibo students and staff.

## Save the times for Term 1 classes
We will share more details on your classes and learning at Kibo during the coming weeks. For now, it's important to remember that the course of study at Kibo is rigorous and requires a significant time commitment. You should plan to set aside:
- 50 hours a week for full-time study
- 20 hours a week for part-time study 

Most of your study time will be self-paced, and you will be expected to block out time for learning. You will also have one mandatory live session each week per class, as well as optional office hours.

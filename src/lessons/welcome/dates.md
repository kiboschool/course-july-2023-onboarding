**On Saturday July 8**, we will have in-person events in our hubs where you will get to meet Kibo students and staff. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kiboschool_kibocsd-kibocsdorientation-kiboschool-activity-6985185304735322112-boNq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">Here is a recap</a> of last year's orientation.

## Save the dates for Term 1 classes
You will receive more details on on your classes and learning at Kibo during the coming weeks. For now, it's important to remember that the course of study at Kibo is rigorous and requires a significant time commitment. You should plan to set aside:
- 50 hours a week for full-time study
- 20 hours a week for part-time study 

Most of your study time will be self-paced, and you will be expected to block out time for learning. You will also have one mandatory live session each week per class, as well as optional office hours.

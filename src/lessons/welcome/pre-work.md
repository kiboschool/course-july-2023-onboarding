  ðŸ—£ **You donâ€™t need to be able to type fast in order to â€˜codeâ€™. But you do if you want to be a highly productive programmer.
 It makes just as much sense to improve your skills on a keyboard as it does to improve your knowledge/skills in your chosen programming language. Both make you more efficient as a programmer.**

# Finalizing your enrollment
You've already taken important steps toward reaching your peak: applying for Kibo, earning admissions, and submitting your enrollment deposit. There are a few  steps needed to officially enroll, namely:
1. Pay your tuition for the first term
2. Complete all onboarding activities (this is what you're doing in this course!)
3. Attend orientation 

Once you have confirmed your enrollment, you must pay the tuition fee listed in the agreement. You must pay the balance of tuition before the beginning of class on July 10, 2023.   Be sure to double check with your bank or funding source, and understand the additional cost/fees associated with transferring funds. Although you have the option to pay your tuition balance per term, it may make sense to pay more upfront to avoid the extra transfer costs.

## Paying your Tuition
Your tuition balance for Term 1 is due on July 10, 2023. You will receive an email reminder 10 days before the due date from the financial aid office. It is your responsibility to pay the tuition balance for the term. If you wish, you may pay for the entire school year ahead.
